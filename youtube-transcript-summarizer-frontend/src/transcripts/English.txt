  And we got the output the code that i'm executing in this session and the question and answers that we will be discussing will be attached in the description box below so you can have a look at it and execute the code for a better understanding and if you face any issues while executing the programs then please let us know in the comment section below and our team of experts will be happier to reach out all your queries at the earliest top third question is what is a binary search tree and explain its properties a binary tree is a complete tray in which every node is spelled except the last level nodes in a binary tree are added from left to right topmost node is a root node of a tree and the sub tree consists of a parent note and a child node the properties of a binary search tree are the left sub tree of a node contain only nodes with a k element less than the root load scheme whereas the right subtree of a node contains the note with key elements greater than the root node scheme the top second question is what is a graph data structure in same a graph is a non-linear data structure it is a collection of a finite set of nodes called points connected through edges called lines as shown in the below diagram just to represent networks such as telephone networks circuit networks and social networks etc now first question is how to implement a program to find the height of a binary tray so as you can see this is a program to find the height of a binary tree which means finding the levels of a binary tree So with this we have come to the end of this session on the top 10 dsa question and answers i hope this session was informative and interesting so if you have any queries regarding any of the topics covered in this session then please feel free to let us know in the comment section below and our team of experts will be happy to resolve all your queries at the earliest until next time this is sanya from the simply learns team signing off.
